1 There's only two people in your life you should lie to... the police and your girlfriend.
2 If men are honest, everything they do and everywhere they go is for a chance to see women.
3 My motto is: more good times.
4 I'm definitely still wild at heart.
5 There were points in my life where I felt oddly irresistible to women. I'm not in that state now and that makes me sad.
6 Almost everybody's happy to be a fool for love.
7 Beer, it's the best damn drink in the world.
8 With my sunglasses on, I'm Jack Nicholson. Without them, I'm fat and 60.
9 Early on, if I was alone two or three nights in a row, I'd start writing poems about suicide.
10 Yeah... I can see what kind of fucking sense that makes.
11 Played tennis for years. But you can't improve at tennis after you're 50. You get to be in your 40s, and suddenly you're a doubles player.
12 It's not like I'm starved for company - I have a few very good lady friends - but there's only a certain amount of times a woman wants to see you and never go out for dinner.
13 Because you know, down deep in my heart, when all is said and done, I still live under the illusion that basically people think of me as an up-and-coming young actor.
14 When I was in high school, I earned the pimple award and every other gross-out award.
15 I'm Irish. I think about death all the time.
16 I am a person who is trained to look other people in the eye.
17 I learned a long time ago in Hollywood that the only person I should vote for is myself.
18 I've spent more time playing golf than anything else the last 18 years. Just wanted to be an 80s-shooter. Got there, too.
19 I'm just your average horny little devil.
20 No novocaine - it dulls the senses!
21 I goddamn near lost my nose - and I like it. I like breathing through it. And I still think you're hiding something.
22 You know... this used to be a hell of a good country.
23 You make me want to be a better man.
24 What do you think you are, crazy or something? Well, you're not! You're not!
25 HEEEERE'S JOHNNY!
26 You can't handle the truth!
27 My mother never saw the irony in calling me a son-of-a-bitch.
28 I only take Viagra when I'm with more than one woman.
29 People who speak in metaphors should shampoo my crotch.
